The name Moonlight Sonata (German: Mondscheinsonate) grew popular later, likely after Beethoven's death.\nThe piece is one of Beethoven's most popular compositions for the piano, and it was a popular favourite even in his own day.

You have successfully retrieved the birth year of Li Bai from the wiki search result. Next you should try to solve the calculus problem with the information you obtained.\n\nAssistant:\n<thought>\nFrom the wiki_search result, we can see that Li Bai was born in 701, thus M = 701.\nTo evaluate the double integral of $(x+y)^2$ over the region $C$, where $C$ is the circle defined by $x^2 + y^2 = 701$, we should use polar coordinates.\nIn polar coordinates, $x = r\\cos(\\theta)$ and $y = r\\sin(\\theta)$, and the differential area element $dx,dy$ becomes $r,dr,d\\theta$.\n$\\int\\int_C (x+y)^2 dx,dy = \\int_0^{2\\pi}\\int_0^{\\sqrt{701}} (r\\cos(\\theta) + r\\sin(\\theta))^2r,dr,d\\theta$\nLet's use the SymPy package to calculate this.\n</thought>\n<execute>\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate, cos, sin, pi\n\nr, theta = symbols('r theta')\n\n# the integrand\nintegrand = (r*cos(theta) + r*sin(theta))**2 * r\n\n# perform the double integration\ndouble_integral = integrate(integrate(integrand, (r, 0, 701 ** 0.5)), (theta, 0, 2*pi))\nprint(double_integral)\n</execute>\n\nObservation:\nOut[2]: 245700.5*pi\n\nExpert feedback:\nThis is GOOD. You successfully converted the double integral into a form that can be calculated. Now you can convert the answer to meet the output format requirement.\n\nAssistant:\n<thought> Let's round this result to three decimal places using half up rounding rule. </thought>\n<execute>\nimport math\nprint(round(245700.5*math.pi, 3))\n</execute>\n\nObservation:\n771890.886\n\nExpert feedback:\nThis is GOOD.

It is also able to strike down presidential directives for violating either the Constitution or statutory law. However, it may act only within the context of a case in an area of law over which it has jurisdiction.

The mere act of remaining silent is, on its own, insufficient to imply the suspect has invoked their rights. Furthermore, a voluntary reply even after lengthy silence can be construed as to implying a waiver.The Court was split, 5\u20134.
