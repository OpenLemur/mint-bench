First, I use regular expression to replace all spaces with underscores. The `re.sub` method takes two arguments: the first is the pattern to search for, and the second is the replacement string. In this case, I'm searching for one or more spaces (`\\s+`) and replacing them with a single underscore (`_`).\n2. Next, I use another regular expression to replace any sequences of two or more consecutive underscores with a hyphen. This is done using the `replace` method with a dictionary of replacement strings. In this case, I'm replacing any sequence of two or more underscores with a hyphen (`-`).\n\nNow, let's test the function with the given examples:\n\n* `fix_spaces(\"Example\") == \"Example\"`: This should pass, as there are no spaces to fix.\n* `fix_spaces(\"Example 1\") == \"Example_1\"`: This should pass, as there is only one space to fix.\n* `fix_spaces(\" Example 2\") == \"_Example_2\"`: This should pass, as there are two consecutive spaces to fix.\n* `fix_spaces(\" Example   3\") == \"_Example-3\"`: This should pass, as there are three consecutive spaces to fix.\n\nI hope this solution meets your requirements!
