The film stars Mason Thames, Madeleine McGraw, Jeremy Davies, James Ransone, and Ethan Hawke.

In the 1960s and 1970s, he moved towards sexploitation and pornographic films such as  The Sinister Urge (1960), Orgy of the Dead (1965) and Necromania (1971), and wrote over 80 lurid pulp crime and sex novels.\nNotable for their campy aesthetics, technical errors, unsophisticated special effects, use of poorly-matched stock footage, eccentric casts, idiosyncratic stories and non sequitur dialogue, Wood's films remained largely obscure until he was posthumously awarded a Golden Turkey Award for Worst Director of All Time in 1980, renewing public interest in his life and work.Following the ...\n[Output Truncated]\nYou have 4 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " Assistant:\n\n<thought> Based on the information provided, Scott Derrickson and Ed Wood were not of the same nationality.
