It looks like my solution is incorrect. Let me think...</thought>\n\n<thought> Wait, I have an idea! Maybe I can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find the sum of the geometric progression series. The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is: n * (a1 + an), where n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the common difference. In this case, we have a1 = 1, an = 5, and n = 2.
