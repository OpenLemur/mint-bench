In the 1960s and 1970s, he moved towards sexploitation and pornographic films such as  The Sinister Urge (1960), Orgy of the Dead (1965) and Necromania (1971), and wrote over 80 lurid pulp crime and sex novels.\nNotable for their campy aesthetics, technical errors, unsophisticated special effects, use of poorly-matched stock footage, eccentric casts, idiosyncratic stories and non sequitur dialogue, Wood's films remained largely obscure until he was posthumously awarded a Golden Turkey Award for Worst Director of All Time in 1980, renewing public interest in his life and work.Following the ...\n[Output Truncated]\nYou have 3 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " Assistant:\n\n<thought> Based on the information provided, Scott Derrickson and Ed Wood were not of the same nationality.

A member of the Republican Party, he also served as the 43rd vice president from 1981 to 1989 under Ronald Reagan, and in various other federal positions prior to that.\nBush was born into a wealthy, established New England family and raised in Greenwich, Connecticut. He attended Phillips Academy before serving as a pilot in the United States Navy Reserve during World War II. Afterward, he graduated from Yale and moved to West Texas, where he established a successful oil company. Following an unsuccessful run for the United States Senate in 1964, he was elected to represent Texas's 7th congressional district in 1966. President Richard Nixon appointed Bush to ambassador to the United Nations in 1971 and to chairman of the Republican National Committee in 1973.

The mere act of remaining silent is, on its own, insufficient to imply the suspect has invoked their rights.
