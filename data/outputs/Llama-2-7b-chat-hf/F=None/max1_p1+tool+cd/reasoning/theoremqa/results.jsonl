Find the characteristic equation: We can do this by determining the determinant of the matrix A and then solving for the eigenvalues.\n$$\\det(A) = \\det\\begin{bmatrix} 5 & 4 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{bmatrix} = 5 \\cdot 4 - 1 \\cdot 2 = 20 - 2 = 18$$\nSo, the characteristic equation is $x^2 - 18x + 18 = 0$.\n2. Solve for the eigenvalues: We can solve for the eigenvalues by factoring the characteristic equation.\n$$(x - 9)(x - 2) = 0$$\nSo, the eigenvalues are $9$ and $2$.\nTherefore, the eigenvalues of the matrix A are [9, 2].\n\nNow, the output format requirement is to provide a list of integers, such as [1, 2, 3].

The centripetal force acting on the automobile as it rounds the curve is equal to the mass of the automobile multiplied by its acceleration, which is given by $a = \\frac{dv}{dt} = \\frac{20}{t}$, where $t$ is the time taken to round the curve.\nThe force of friction between the tires and the road can be calculated as $F_f = \\mu_k N$, where $\\mu_k$ is the coefficient of kinetic friction and $N$ is the normal force acting on the tires.\nSince the automobile is moving at a speed of 30 m/s, the normal force acting on the tires is $N = mg$, where $m$ is the mass of the automobile and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.\nNow, we need to find the minimum coefficient of static friction required to prevent skidding. We can use the following equation:\n$F_f = \\mu_k N = \\mu_k mg$\nRearranging this equation, we get:\n$\\mu_k = \\frac{F_f}{N} = \\frac{mg}{N}$\nSince we are given that the automobile has a mass of 1000 kg, the minimum coefficient of static friction required to prevent skidding is:\n$\\mu_k = \\frac{mg}{N} = \\frac{1000 kg \\times 9.8 m/s^2}{N} = 0.25$\n\nTherefore, the minimum coefficient of static friction required to prevent skidding is <solution> 0.25 </solution>.\n"}], "finished": true, "success": false, "latest_output": {"content": "You are a helpful assistant assigned with the task of problem-solving.

The Simpson's rule is a method for approximating definite integrals using a parabolic interpolation.\nHere's how we can use the Simpson's rule to approximate the value of the integral:\n1.
