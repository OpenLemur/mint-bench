The film stars James Dean, Natalie Wood, Sal Mineo, Jim Backus, Ann Doran, Corey Allen and William Hopper. Dennis Hopper made his debut in a brief role as a goon.\nThe film was an attempt to portray the moral decay of American youth, critique parental style, and explore the differences and conflicts between generations. In this film's case, it was the Interbellum Generation vs the Silent Generation. The title was adopted from psychiatrist Robert M.

The same syndrome shared by more than two people may be called folie \u00e0 trois ('three') or quatre ('four'); and further, folie en famille ('family madness') or even folie \u00e0 plusieurs ('madness of several').\nThe disorder, first conceptualized in 19th-century French psychiatry by Charles Las\u00e8gue and Jules Falret, is also known as Las\u00e8gue\u2013Falret syndrome.Recent psychiatric classifications refer to the syndrome as shared psychotic disorder (DSM-4 \u2013 297.3) and induced delusional disorder (ICD-10 \u2013 F24), although the research literature largely uses the original name.\nThis disorder is not in the current, fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disor\nYou have 4 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\n\nExpert feedback:\nThis is NOT GOOD.

As with their previous two albums From Under the Cork Tree (2005) and Infinity on High (2007), its music was composed by lead vocalist and guitarist Patrick Stump, with lyrics penned by bassist Pete Wentz. Regarding the writing process, the band considered Folie \u00e0 Deux to be their most collaborative record.\nUnlike their earlier releases, the album was recorded in relative secrecy with producer Neal Avron from July to September 2008. The recording sessions inspired lyricism relating to decaying relationships, moral dilemmas, and societal shortcomings, many with a political edge. The album's style moved away from early emo power chords and toward a wider variation in genres.

Its design was revolutionary for its time, featuring a retractable roof and air conditioning system, which made it possible to host events in a climate-controlled environment.\n2. Size: The Astrodome was a massive structure, with a seating capacity of over 50,000 people. Its sheer size and scale were impressive, making it a marvel of modern engineering.\n3. Engineering feats: The construction of the Astrodome required significant engineering innovations, including the use of pre-stressed concrete, which allowed for the creation of the dome's unique shape, and the installation of the retractable roof, which was a complex mechanical system.\n\nThese factors, combined with its cultural significance and impact on the city of Houston, led to the Astrodome being dubbed the Eighth Wonder of the World.\n\nNote: This answer is based on the subjective criteria and opinions of people who called the Astrodome the Eighth Wonder of the World.

Bush\nSummary: George Herbert Walker Bush (June 12, 1924 \u2013 November 30, 2018) was an American politician, diplomat, and businessman who served as the 41st president of the United States from 1989 to 1993. A member of the Republican Party, he also served as the 43rd vice president from 1981 to 1989 under Ronald Reagan, and in various other federal positions prior to that.\nBush was born into a wealthy, established New England family and raised in Greenwich, Connecticut. He attended Phillips Academy before serving as a pilot in the United States Navy Reserve during World War II. Afterward, he graduated from Yale and moved to West Texas, where he established a successful oil company. Following an unsuccessful run for the United States Senate in 1964, he was elected to represent Texas's 7th congressional district in 1966. President Richard Nixon appointed Bush to ambassador to the United Nations in 1971 and to chairman of the Republican National Committee in 1973.
