As such, neoclassicism was a reaction against the unrestrained emotionalism and perceived formlessness of late Romanticism, as well as a \"call to order\" after the experimental ferment of the first two decades of the twentieth century. The neoclassical impulse found its expression in such features as the use of pared-down performing forces, an emphasis on rhythm and on contrapuntal texture, an updated or expanded tonal harmony, and a concentration on absolute music as opposed to Romantic program music.\nIn form and thematic technique, neoclassical music often drew inspiration from music of the eighteenth century, though the inspiring canon belonged as frequently to the Bar\nYou have 4 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Assistant:\n<thought> From the wiki_search result, it seems that the term \"Op. 5\" is more related to Neoclassicism in music rather than the Italian Baroque period.

Your thought process should be enclosed using \"<thought>\" tag, for example: <thought> I need to print \"Hello World!\" </thought>.\n\nAfter that, you have two options:\n\n1) Interact with a Python programming environment and receive the corresponding output. Your code should be enclosed using \"<execute>\" tag, for example: <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>.\n2) Directly provide a solution that adheres to the required format for the given task. Your solution should be enclosed using \"<solution>\" tag, for example: The answer is <solution> A </solution>.\n\nYou have 5 chances to interact with the environment or propose a solution.
