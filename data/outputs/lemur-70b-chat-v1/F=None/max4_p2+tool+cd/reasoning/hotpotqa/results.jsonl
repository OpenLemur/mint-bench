Dennis Hopper made his debut in a brief role as a goon.\nThe film was an attempt to portray the moral decay of American youth, critique parental style, and explore the differences and conflicts between generations.

The style began at the start of the 17th century in Rome, then spread rapidly to the rest of Italy, France, Spain and Portugal, then to Austria, southern Germany, and Poland.

The mere act of remaining silent is, on its own, insufficient to imply the suspect has invoked their rights. Furthermore, a voluntary reply even after lengthy silence can be construed as to implying a waiver.The Court was split, 5\u20134.
