The film stars James Dean, Natalie Wood, Sal Mineo, Jim Backus, Ann Doran, Corey Allen and William Hopper. Dennis Hopper made his debut in a brief role as a goon.\nThe film was an attempt to portray the moral decay of American youth, critique parental style, and explore the differences and conflicts between generations. In this film's case, it was the Interbellum Generation vs the Silent Generation. The title was adopted from psychiatrist Robert M.

Science fiction films have often been used to focus on political or social issues, and to explore philosophical issues like the human condition.\nThe genre has existed since the early years of silent cinema, when Georges Melies' A Trip to the Moon (1902) employed trick photography effects. The next major example (first in feature-length in the genre) was the film Metropolis (1927). From the 1930s to the 1950s, the genre consisted mainly of low-budget B movies.

A dynasty may also be referred to as a \"house\", \"family\" or \"clan\", among others. \nHistorians periodize the histories of many states and civilizations, such as Ancient Iran (3200 \u2013 539 BC), Ancient Egypt (3100 \u2013 30 BC), and Ancient and Imperial China (2070 BC \u2013 AD 1912), using a framework of successive dynasties. As such, the term \"dynasty\" may be used to delimit the era during which a family reigned. \nBefore the 18th century, most dynasties throughout the world have traditionally been reckoned patrilineally, such as those that follow the Frankish Salic law. In polities where it was permitted, succession through a daughter usually established a new dynasty in her husband's family name.

The mere act of remaining silent is, on its own, insufficient to imply the suspect has invoked their rights. Furthermore, a voluntary reply even after lengthy silence can be construed as to implying a waiver.The Court was split, 5\u20134.
