The film stars Mason Thames, Madeleine McGraw, Jeremy Davies, James Ransone, and Ethan Hawke.

In the 1960s and 1970s, he moved towards sexploitation and pornographic films such as  The Sinister Urge (1960), Orgy of the Dead (1965) and Necromania (1971), and wrote over 80 lurid pulp crime and sex novels.\nNotable for their campy aesthetics, technical errors, unsophisticated special effects, use of poorly-matched stock footage, eccentric casts, idiosyncratic stories and non sequitur dialogue, Wood's films remained largely obscure until he was posthumously awarded a Golden Turkey Award for Worst Director of All Time in 1980, renewing public interest in his life and work.Following the ...\n[Output Truncated]\nYou have 2 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Assistant:\n\n<thought>\nFrom the wiki_search results, we can see that Scott Derrickson is an American filmmaker, while Ed Wood is an American filmmaker.\nTherefore, they are of the same nationality.\n</thought>\n<execute>\nprint(\"Yes\")\n</execute>\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Observation:\nYes\nYou have 1 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\nYou should take the last step to propose a solution.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Assistant:\n\n<thought>\nThe answer is <solution> Yes </solution>.\n</thought>\n"}], "finished": true, "success": true, "latest_output": {"observation": "Yes", "feedback": "", "feedback_type": "no_feedback", "success": false, "content": "Observation:\nYes\nYou have 1 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\nYou should take the last step to propose a solution.\n"}, "agent_action_count": {"propose_solution": 1, "use_tool": 2, "invalid_action": 0}, "token_counter": {"prompt_tokens": 4604, "total_tokens": 4779, "completion_tokens": 175}, "terminate_reason": "task_success", "error": null}, "task": {"task_name": "reasoning", "task_id": 0, "prompt": "Were Scott Derrickson and Ed Wood of the same nationality?", "reference": "yes", "metadata": {}}}

Outside of his work in Hall & Oates, he has also released five solo albums, including the 1980 progressive rock collaboration with guitarist Robert Fripp titled Sacred Songs and the 1986 album Three Hearts in the Happy Ending Machine,  which provided his best selling single, \"Dreamtime\", that peaked at number five on the Billboard Hot 100.  He has also collaborated on numerous works by other artists, such as Fripp's 1979 release Exposure, and Dusty Springfield's 1995 album A Very Fine Love, which produced a UK Top 40 hit with \"Wherever Would I Be\".

He was the younger brother of fellow band member Freddie Marsden.\nGerry and the Pacemakers had the distinction of being the first act to have their first three recordings go to number 1 in the UK charts. Although they never had a number 1 in the United States, they were the second-most successful group from Liverpool, after the Beatles, to have hits on the United States pop charts.
