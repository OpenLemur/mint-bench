Robert Cargill, who both produced with Jason Blum. It is an adaptation of the 2004 short story of the same name by Joe Hill. The film stars Mason Thames, Madeleine McGraw, Jeremy Davies, James Ransone, and Ethan Hawke. In the film, an abducted teenager (Thames) uses a mysterious telephone to communicate with the previous victims of his deranged captor (Hawke).\nDerrickson came on board to direct The Black Phone after departing Marvel Studios' Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness over creative differences.

In the 1960s and 1970s, he moved towards sexploitation and pornographic films such as  The Sinister Urge (1960), Orgy of the Dead (1965) and Necromania (1971), and wrote over 80 lurid pulp crime and sex novels.\nNotable for their campy aesthetics, technical errors, unsophisticated special effects, use of poorly-matched stock footage, eccentric casts, idiosyncratic stories and non sequitur dialogue, Wood's films remained largely obscure until he was posthumously awarded a Golden Turkey Award for Worst Director of All Time in 1980, renewing public interest in his life and work.Following the ...\n[Output Truncated]\nYou have 2 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Assistant:\n\n<thought>\nFrom the wiki_search result, we can see that Scott Derrickson is American and Ed Wood is American.\n</thought>\n<execute>\nprint('Scott Derrickson is American')\nprint('Ed Wood is American')\n</execute>\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Observation:\nScott Derrickson is American\nEd Wood is American\nYou have 1 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\nYou should take the last step to propose a solution.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Assistant:\n\n<thought>\nFrom the wiki_search result, we can see that Scott Derrickson is American and Ed Wood is American.\n</thought>\n<execute>\nprint('Scott Derrickson is American')\nprint('Ed Wood is American')\n</execute>\n"}], "finished": true, "success": false, "latest_output": {"observation": "Scott Derrickson is American\nEd Wood is American", "feedback": "", "feedback_type": "no_feedback", "success": false, "content": "Observation:\nScott Derrickson is American\nEd Wood is American\nYou have 1 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\nYou should take the last step to propose a solution.\n"}, "agent_action_count": {"propose_solution": 0, "use_tool": 3, "invalid_action": 0}, "token_counter": {"prompt_tokens": 4620, "total_tokens": 4834, "completion_tokens": 214}, "terminate_reason": "max_steps", "error": null}, "task": {"task_name": "reasoning", "task_id": 0, "prompt": "Were Scott Derrickson and Ed Wood of the same nationality?", "reference": "yes", "metadata": {}}, "final_length_exceeds_4096": false}

Harrison began writing the song in 1967, while he was a member of the Beatles, in response to the public outcry surrounding bandmate Paul McCartney's admission that he had taken the hallucinogenic drug LSD. McCartney's announcement created a reaction in the press similar to that caused in 1966 by John Lennon's statement that the Beatles were more popular than Christianity. In its finished form, the song's lyrics advocate self-awareness and consideration for the consequences of one's actions. Musically, the composition contains unusual shifts in time signature from standard 4/4 to 9/8, while the songwords reflect the era of its genesis by recalling themes first espoused in the Beatles tracks \"Within You Without You\" and \"All You Need Is Love\".\nHarrison recorded \"See Yourself\" at his Friar Park home studio in Henley, Oxfordshire.

Examples of word play include puns, phonetic mix-ups such as spoonerisms, obscure words and meanings, clever rhetorical excursions, oddly formed sentences, double entendres, and telling character names (such as in the play The Importance of Being Earnest, Ernest being a given name that sounds exactly like the adjective earnest).\nWord play is quite common in oral cultures as a method of reinforcing meaning. Examples of text-based (orthographic) word play are found in languages with or without alphabet-based scripts, such as homophonic puns in Mandarin Chinese.\n\n\n\nPage: Peter Taylor (footballer, born 1928)\nSummary: Peter Thomas Taylor (2 July 1928 \u2013 4 October 1990) was an English football player and manager.

The film stars James Dean, Natalie Wood, Sal Mineo, Jim Backus, Ann Doran, Corey Allen and William Hopper. Dennis Hopper made his debut in a brief role as a goon.\nThe film was an attempt to portray the moral decay of American youth, critique parental style, and explore the differences and conflicts between generations. In this film's case, it was the Interbellum Generation vs the Silent Generation. The title was adopted from psychiatrist Robert M. Lindner's 1944 book, Rebel Without a Cause: The Hypnoanalysis of a Criminal Psychopath. The film itself does not make any references to Lindner's book in any way.

Often its subject is an original work or some aspect of it (theme/content, author, style, etc), but a parody can also be about a real-life person (e.g. a politician), event, or movement (e.g. the French Revolution or 1960s counterculture). Literary scholar Professor Simon Dentith defines parody as \"any cultural practice which provides a relatively polemical allusive imitation of another cultural production or practice\". The literary theorist Linda Hutcheon said \"parody ... is imitation, not always at the expense of the parodied text.\" \nParody may be found in art or culture, including literature, music, theater, television and film, animation, and gaming.

He realised that contemporary engine designs wasted a great deal of energy by repeatedly cooling and reheating the cylinder. Watt introduced a design enhancement, the separate condenser, which avoided this waste of energy and radically improved the power, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of steam engines. Eventually, he adapted his engine to produce rotary motion, greatly broadening its use beyond pumping water.\nWatt attempted to commercialise his invention, but experienced great fi\nYou have 2 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Assistant:\n\n<thought>\nFrom the wiki_search result, we can see that James Watt was born in 1736, thus M = 1736.\nTo evaluate the double integral of $(x+y)^2$ over the region $C$, where $C$ is the circle defined by $x^2 + y^2 = 1736$, we should use polar coordinates.\nIn polar coordinates, $x = r\\cos(\\theta)$ and $y = r\\sin(\\theta)$, and the differential area element $dx,dy$ becomes $r,dr,d\\theta$.\n$\\int\\int_C (x+y)^2 dx,dy = \\int_0^{2\\pi}\\int_0^{\\sqrt{1736}} (r\\cos(\\theta) + r\\sin(\\theta))^2r,dr,d\\theta$\nLet's use the SymPy package to calculate this.\n</thought>\n<execute>\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate, cos, sin, pi\n\nr, theta = symbols('r theta')\n\n# the integrand\nintegrand = (r*cos(theta) + r*sin(theta))**2 * r\n\n# perform the double integration\ndouble_integral = integrate(integrate(integrand, (r, 0, 1736 ** 0.5)), (theta, 0, 2*pi))\nprint(double_integral)\n</execute>\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Observation:\n1506848.0*pi\nYou have 1 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\nYou should take the last step to propose a solution.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Assistant:\n\n<thought> Let's round this result to three decimal places using half up rounding rule. </thought>\n<execute>\nimport math\nprint(round(1506848.0*math.pi, 3))\n</execute>\n"}], "finished": true, "success": false, "latest_output": {"observation": "1506848.0*pi", "feedback": "", "feedback_type": "no_feedback", "success": false, "content": "Observation:\n1506848.0*pi\nYou have 1 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\nYou should take the last step to propose a solution.\n"}, "agent_action_count": {"propose_solution": 0, "use_tool": 3, "invalid_action": 0}, "token_counter": {"prompt_tokens": 4171, "total_tokens": 4631, "completion_tokens": 460}, "terminate_reason": "max_steps", "error": null}, "task": {"task_name": "reasoning", "task_id": 29, "prompt": "What prolific English engineer, who died on 15 December 1857, contributed to the advent of the hot air engine by way of their open cycle devices?", "reference": "george cayley", "metadata": {}}, "final_length_exceeds_4096": false}
