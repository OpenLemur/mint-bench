Here is the correct solution:\n\n```python\ndef minSubArraySum(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given an array of integers nums, find the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array\n    of nums.\n    Example\n    minSubArraySum([2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4]) == 1\n    minSubArraySum([-1, -2, -3]) == -6\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the minimum sum to the largest possible value.\n    min_sum = float(\"inf\")\n\n    # Initialize the current sum to the first element of the array.\n    current_sum = nums[0]\n\n    # Iterate over the rest of the array.\n    for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n        # Update the current sum by adding the current element.\n        current_sum += nums[i]\n\n        # Update the minimum sum if the current sum is less than the minimum sum.\n        min_sum = min(min_sum, current_sum)\n\n    # Initialize the ending index to the first element of the array.\n    ending_index = 0\n\n    # Iterate over the rest of the array.\n    for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n        # Update the ending index if the current sum is less than the minimum sum.\n        if current_sum - nums[i] < min_sum:\n            ending_index = i\n\n    # Return the minimum sum.\n    return min_sum + nums[ending_index]\n```\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of the solution:\n\n1. We initialize the minimum sum to the largest possible value. This is because the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array must be at least 0, and the largest possible value is infinity.\n2. We initialize the current sum to the first element of the array. This is because the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array must include the first element of the array.\n3.

We update the minimum sum if the current sum is less than the minimum sum. This is because the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array must be at least the current sum.\n6. We initialize the ending index to the first element of the array.\n7. We iterate over the rest of the array.\n8. For each element in the array, we update the ending index if the current sum is less than the minimum sum.

Your task is to find the closest vowel that stands between \n    two consonants from the right side of the word (case sensitive).\n    \n    Vowels in the beginning and ending doesn't count. Return empty string if you didn't\n    find any vowel met the above condition. \n\n    You may assume that the given string contains English letter only.\n\n    Example:\n    get_closest_vowel(\"yogurt\") ==> \"u\"\n    get_closest_vowel(\"FULL\") ==> \"U\"\n    get_closest_vowel(\"quick\") ==> \"\"\n    get_closest_vowel(\"ab\") ==> \"\"\n    \"\"\"\n\n    vowels = \"aeiou\"\n    for i in range(len(word) - 1, -1, -1):\n        if word[i] in vowels:\n            if word[i - 1].isalpha() and word[i + 1].isalpha():\n                return word[i]\n    return \"\"\n```\n\nHere is my thought process for solving the task:\n\n* First, I need to identify the vowels in the English alphabet. I can do this by looking up the definition of a vowel, which is a letter that represents a sound produced by the vocal cords with relatively open vocal tract. The vowels in the English alphabet are a, e, i, o, and u.\n* Next, I need to iterate through the word from right to left, checking each letter to see if it is a vowel. If it is, I need to check the two letters before it to see if they are consonants. If they are, then I have found the closest vowel that stands between two consonants from the right side of the word.\n* Finally, I need to return the vowel if I found one, or an empty string if I did not.\n\nHere is my code:\n\n```python\ndef get_closest_vowel(word):\n    \"\"\"You are given a word. Your task is to find the closest vowel that stands between \n    two consonants from the right side of the word (case sensitive).\n    \n    Vowels in the beginning and ending doesn't count.
