He was a self-taught engineer and inventor who worked on a variety of projects, including steam engines, hot air engines, and internal combustion engines.\n\nStirling's first patent was for a steam engine in 1816. He then went on to develop a hot air engine in 1816. His hot air engine was a closed cycle device, which means that the air was compressed before it was heated. This made his engine more efficient than Morey's design.\n\nStirling continued to work on his hot air engine until his death in 1878. He never achieved commercial success with his inventions, but he is considered to be one of the pioneers of internal combustion engines.\n\nIn addition to his work on engines, Stirling also invented a number of other devices, including a water wheel, a sawmill, and a threshing machine. He was also a prolific writer and published several books on engineering and invention.\n\nStirling was a brilliant engineer and inventor who made significant contributions to the development of internal combustion engines. He is a true Scottish pioneer and his work continues to inspire engineers today.\n"}], "finished": true, "success": false, "latest_output": {"observation": null, "feedback": "", "feedback_type": "no_feedback", "success": false, "content": "Observation:\nYour answer is wrong.\nYou have 1 steps left and 1 chances to propose solution left.\nYou should take the last step to propose a solution.\n"}, "agent_action_count": {"propose_solution": 2, "use_tool": 0, "invalid_action": 1}, "token_counter": {"token_count": 4201}, "terminate_reason": "max_propose_steps", "error": null}, "task": {"task_name": "reasoning", "task_id": 29, "prompt": "What prolific English engineer, who died on 15 December 1857, contributed to the advent of the hot air engine by way of their open cycle devices?", "reference": "george cayley", "metadata": {}}}
