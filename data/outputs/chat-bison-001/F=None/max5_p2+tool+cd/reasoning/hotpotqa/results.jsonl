He met John Lennon and Paul McCartney in 1957, and the three of them formed the band The Quarrymen, which later became The Beatles.\n\nHarrison was a prolific songwriter, and he wrote many of The Beatles' most famous songs, including \"Here Comes the Sun,\" \"Something,\" and \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps.\" He was also a skilled guitarist, and he played a variety of instruments, including the sitar and the tabla.\n\nHarrison left The Beatles in 1970, and he went on to have a successful solo career. He released several albums, including \"All Things Must Pass,\" \"Living in the Material World,\" and \"Cloud Nine.\" He also formed the band The Traveling Wilburys with Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison, Tom Petty, and Jeff Lynne.\n\nHarrison died of lung cancer on November 29, 2001. He was 58 years old. He is survived by his wife Olivia and his son Dhani.\n\nHarrison was a talented musician and songwriter, and he made a significant contribution to popular music.

He then went on to develop a hot air engine in 1829. His hot air engine was an open cycle device, which means that the air was not compressed before it was heated. This made his engine less efficient than later designs, but it was still a significant advance at the time.\n\nMorey continued to work on his hot air engine until his death in 1857. He never achieved commercial success with his inventions, but he is considered to be one of the pioneers of internal combustion engines.\n\nIn addition to his work on engines, Morey also invented a number of other devices, including a water wheel, a sawmill, and a threshing machine.

Texas.\n\nThe Supreme Court of the United States has decided many cases by a 5-4 vote. Some of the most famous cases include Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion, and Bush v. Gore, which decided the 2000 presidential election.\n\nIn between Berghuis v. Thompkins (2010) and Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan (1982), the Supreme Court decided the following cases by a 5-4 vote:\n\n* Lawrence v. Texas (2003): The Court ruled that laws criminalizing same-sex sexual activity are unconstitutional.\n* Grutter v. Bollinger (2003): The Court upheld the use of affirmative action in college admissions.\n* Hamdi v. Rumsfeld (2004): The Court ruled that the government must provide a hearing to a U.S. citizen who is detained as an enemy combatant.\n* Rasul v. Bush (2004): The Court ruled that U.S. citizens who are detained at Guantanamo Bay have the right to challenge their detention in federal court.\n* Hamdan v. Rumsfeld (2006): The Court ruled that the military commissions established by the Bush administration to try enemy combatants were unconstitutional.\n* Boumediene v. Bush (2008): The Court ruled that U.S. citizens who are detained at Guantanamo Bay have the right to habeas corpus, which is a legal process that allows people to challenge their detention in court.\n\nThese cases are just a few examples of the many important cases that the Supreme Court has decided by a 5-4 vote.
