We initialize the result to 0. This will store the maximum sum of bi-tonic sub-sequences found so far.\n2. We initialize the dp array to 0. This array will store the maximum sum of bi-tonic sub-sequences ending at each index in the array.\n3. We initialize the prefix sum array to 0. This array will store the sum of the elements from index 0 to index $i$.\n4. We initialize the suffix sum array to 0. This array will store the sum of the elements from index $i$ to index $n - 1$.\n5. We fill the prefix sum array. This is done by simply adding the current element to the previous element in the array.\n6. We fill the suffix sum array. This is done by simply adding the current element to the previous element in the array, starting from the end of the array.\n7. We fill the dp array. This is done by taking the maximum of the prefix sum and the suffix sum at each index, plus the current element.\n8. We find the maximum sum. This is done by simply taking the maximum of all the values in the dp array.\n9. We return the maximum sum.
