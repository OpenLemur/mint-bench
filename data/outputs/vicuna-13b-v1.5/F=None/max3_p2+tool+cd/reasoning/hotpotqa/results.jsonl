Robert Cargill, who both produced with Jason Blum. It is an adaptation of the 2004 short story of the same name by Joe Hill. The film stars Mason Thames, Madeleine McGraw, Jeremy Davies, James Ransone, and Ethan Hawke. In the film, an abducted teenager (Thames) uses a mysterious telephone to communicate with the previous victims of his deranged captor (Hawke).\nDerrickson came on board to direct The Black Phone after departing Marvel Studios' Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness over creative differences.

In the 1960s and 1970s, he moved towards sexploitation and pornographic films such as  The Sinister Urge (1960), Orgy of the Dead (1965) and Necromania (1971), and wrote over 80 lurid pulp crime and sex novels.\nNotable for their campy aesthetics, technical errors, unsophisticated special effects, use of poorly-matched stock footage, eccentric casts, idiosyncratic stories and non sequitur dialogue, Wood's films remained largely obscure until he was posthumously awarded a Golden Turkey Award for Worst Director of All Time in 1980, renewing public interest in his life and work.Following the ...\n[Output Truncated]\nYou have 2 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Assistant:\n<thought> Scott Derrickson is an American filmmaker, while Ed Wood was an American filmmaker, actor, and pulp novel author. </thought>\n<execute> print(wikipedia_search('Scott Derrickson')) print(wikipedia_search('Ed Wood')) </execute>\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Observation:\nCell In[2], line 1\n    print(wikipedia_search('Scott Derrickson')) print(wikipedia_search('Ed Wood'))\n                                                ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\nYou have 1 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\nYou should take the last step to propose a solution.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Assistant:\n<thought> I apologize for the mistake.

When these had to be discontinued for reasons which were not officially told, the organisation published its material in a series of multi-lingual books in co-operation with sponsors.

He served in the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the Second World War. He became a fighter pilot and, subsequently, an intelligence officer, rising to the rank of acting wing commander. He rose to prominence as a writer in the 1940s with works for children and for adults, and he became one of the world's best-selling authors. His awards for contribution to literature include the 1983 World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement and the British Book Awards' Children's Author of the Year in 1990.

Hadi Choopan currently holds the title.\nThe film Pumping Iron (1977) featured the buildup to the 1975 Mr. Olympia in Pretoria, South Africa, and helped launch the acting careers of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Lou Ferrigno, and Franco Columbu.There is also a female bodybuilder crowned, Ms. Olympia, as well as winners of Fitness Olympia and Figure Olympia fo\nYou have 1 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\nYou should take the last step to propose a solution.\n"}, "agent_action_count": {"propose_solution": 0, "use_tool": 3, "invalid_action": 0}, "token_counter": {"prompt_tokens": 4189, "total_tokens": 4409, "completion_tokens": 220}, "terminate_reason": "max_steps", "error": null}, "task": {"task_name": "reasoning", "task_id": 17, "prompt": "Who designed the hotel that held the IFBB professional bodybuilding competition in September 1991?", "reference": "architect michael graves", "metadata": {}}}
