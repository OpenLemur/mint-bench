The Formula One World Championship season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix, held usually on purpose-built circuits, and in a few cases on closed city streets. The World Drivers' Championship is presented by the FIA to the most successful Formula One driver over the course of the season through a points system based on individual Grand Prix results. The World Championship is won when it is no longer mathematically possible for another competitor to overtake their points total regardless of the outcome of the remaining races, although it is not officially awarded until the FIA Prize Giving Ceremony held in various cities following the\nYou have 3 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Assistant:\n\n<thought>\nFrom the wiki_search result, we can see that the other Mexican Formula One race car driver who has held the podium besides Sergio P\u00e9rez is Pedro Rodr\u00edguez.\n</thought>\n<execute>\nprint(wikipedia_search('Pedro Rodr\u00edguez'))\n</execute>\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Observation:\nPage: Pedro (footballer, born 1987)\nSummary: Pedro Eliezer Rodr\u00edguez Ledesma (born 28 July 1987), known as Pedro, is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a winger for Serie A club Lazio.\nPedro scored 99 goals in 321 appearances across all competitions for Barcelona from 2008 to 2015.

As such, the term \"dynasty\" may be used to delimit the era during which a family reigned. \nBefore the 18th century, most dynasties throughout the world have traditionally been reckoned patrilineally, such as those that follow the Frankish Salic law. In polities where it was permitted, succession through a daughter usually established a new dynasty in her husband's family name.
