The neutron cross section \u03c3 can be defined as the area in cm2 for which the number of neutron-nuclei reactions taking place is equal to the product of the number of incident neutrons that would pass through the area and the number of target nuclei. In conjunction with the neutron flux, it enables the calculation of the reaction rate, for example to derive the thermal power of a nuclear power plant. The standard unit for measuring the cross section is the barn, which is equal to 10\u221228 m2 or 10\u221224 cm2. The larger the neutron cross section, the more likely a neutron will react with the nucleus.\nAn isotope (or nuclide) can be classified according to its neutron cross section and how it reacts to an incident neutron.

It came into use in 1999, and has replaced Fast Ethernet in wired local networks due to its considerable speed improvement over Fast Ethernet, as well as its use of cables and equipment that are widely available, economical, and similar to previous standards.
