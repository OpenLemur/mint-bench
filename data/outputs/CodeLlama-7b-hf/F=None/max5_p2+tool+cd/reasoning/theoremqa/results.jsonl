The fusion reactions take place in these devices by accelerating either deuterium, tritium, or a mixture of these two isotopes into a metal hydride target which also contains deuterium, tritium or a mixture of these isotopes. Fusion of deuterium atoms (D + D) results in the formation of a helium-3 ion and a neutron with a kinetic energy of approximately 2.5 MeV. Fusion of a deuterium and a tritium atom (D + T) results in the formation of a helium-4 ion and a neutron with a kinetic energy of approximately 14.1 MeV. Neutron generators have applications in medicine, security, and materials analysis.The basic concept was first developed by Ernest Rutherford's team in the Cavendish Laboratory in the early 1930s.

Wavelength is a characteristic of both traveling waves and standing waves, as well as other spatial wave patterns. The inverse of the wavelength is called the spatial frequency. Wavelength is commonly designated by the Greek letter lambda (\u03bb).\nThe term \"wavelength\" is also sometimes applied to modulated waves, and to the sinusoidal envelopes of modulated waves or waves formed by interference of several sinusoids.Assuming a sinusoidal wave moving at a fixed wave speed, wavelength is inversely proportional to the frequency of the wave: waves with higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths, and lower frequencies have longer wavelengths.Wavelength depends on the m\nYou have 4 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Assistant:\n\n<thought>\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Observation:\nI don't understand your input. \nIf you want to execute code, please use <execute> YOUR_CODE_HERE </execute>.\nIf you want to give me an answer, please use <solution> YOUR_SOLUTION_HERE </solution>.\nFor example: The answer to the question is <solution> 42 </solution>. \n\nYou have 3 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Assistant:\n\n<thought>\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Observation:\nI don't understand your input. \nIf you want to execute code, please use <execute> YOUR_CODE_HERE </execute>.\nIf you want to give me an answer, please use <solution> YOUR_SOLUTION_HERE </solution>.\nFor example: The answer to the question is <solution> 42 </solution>. \n\nYou have 2 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Assistant:\n\n<thought>\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Observation:\nI don't understand your input. \nIf you want to execute code, please use <execute> YOUR_CODE_HERE </execute>.\nIf you want to give me an answer, please use <solution> YOUR_SOLUTION_HERE </solution>.\nFor example: The answer to the question is <solution> 42 </solution>. \n\nYou have 1 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\nYou should take the last step to propose a solution.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Assistant:\n\n<thought>\n"}], "finished": true, "success": false, "latest_output": {"observation": "I don't understand your input. \nIf you want to execute code, please use <execute> YOUR_CODE_HERE </execute>.\nIf you want to give me an answer, please use <solution> YOUR_SOLUTION_HERE </solution>.\nFor example: The answer to the question is <solution> 42 </solution>. \n", "feedback": "", "feedback_type": "no_feedback", "success": false, "content": "Observation:\nI don't understand your input. \nIf you want to execute code, please use <execute> YOUR_CODE_HERE </execute>.\nIf you want to give me an answer, please use <solution> YOUR_SOLUTION_HERE </solution>.\nFor example: The answer to the question is <solution> 42 </solution>. \n\nYou have 1 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\nYou should take the last step to propose a solution.\n"}, "agent_action_count": {"propose_solution": 0, "use_tool": 1, "invalid_action": 4}, "token_counter": {"prompt_tokens": 7343, "total_tokens": 9453, "completion_tokens": 2110}, "terminate_reason": "max_steps", "error": null}, "task": {"task_name": "reasoning", "task_id": 11, "prompt": "Answer the following question with a number, a list of numbers or True or False.

It is a bright, slightly orange-yellow, dense, soft, malleable, and ductile metal in pure form. Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element. It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions.\nGold often occurs in free elemental (native state), as nuggets or grains, in rocks, veins, and alluvial deposits. It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver (as in electrum), naturally alloyed with other metals like copper and palladium, and mineral inclusions such as within pyrite. Less commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, often with tellurium (gold tellurides).\nGold is resistant to most acids, though it does dissolve in aqua regia (a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid), forming a soluble tetrachloroaurate anion.

There are several types of friction:\n\nDry friction is a force that opposes the relative lateral motion of two solid surfaces in contact. Dry friction is subdivided into static friction (\"stiction\") between non-moving surfaces, and kinetic friction between moving surfaces. With the exception of atomic or molecular friction, dry friction generally arises from the interaction of surface features, known as asperities (see Figure 1).\nFluid friction describes the friction between layers of a viscous fluid that are moving relative to each other.Lubricated friction is a case of fluid friction where a lubricant fluid separates two solid surfaces.Skin friction is a component of drag, the force resisting the motion of a fluid across the surface of a body.\nInternal friction is the force resisting motion between the elements making up a solid\nYou have 4 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Assistant:\n\n<thought>\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Observation:\nI don't understand your input. \nIf you want to execute code, please use <execute> YOUR_CODE_HERE </execute>.\nIf you want to give me an answer, please use <solution> YOUR_SOLUTION_HERE </solution>.\nFor example: The answer to the question is <solution> 42 </solution>. \n\nYou have 3 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Assistant:\n\n<thought>\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Observation:\nI don't understand your input. \nIf you want to execute code, please use <execute> YOUR_CODE_HERE </execute>.\nIf you want to give me an answer, please use <solution> YOUR_SOLUTION_HERE </solution>.\nFor example: The answer to the question is <solution> 42 </solution>. \n\nYou have 2 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Assistant:\n\n<thought>\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Observation:\nI don't understand your input. \nIf you want to execute code, please use <execute> YOUR_CODE_HERE </execute>.\nIf you want to give me an answer, please use <solution> YOUR_SOLUTION_HERE </solution>.\nFor example: The answer to the question is <solution> 42 </solution>. \n\nYou have 1 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\nYou should take the last step to propose a solution.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Assistant:\n\n<thought>\n"}], "finished": true, "success": false, "latest_output": {"observation": "I don't understand your input. \nIf you want to execute code, please use <execute> YOUR_CODE_HERE </execute>.\nIf you want to give me an answer, please use <solution> YOUR_SOLUTION_HERE </solution>.\nFor example: The answer to the question is <solution> 42 </solution>. \n", "feedback": "", "feedback_type": "no_feedback", "success": false, "content": "Observation:\nI don't understand your input. \nIf you want to execute code, please use <execute> YOUR_CODE_HERE </execute>.\nIf you want to give me an answer, please use <solution> YOUR_SOLUTION_HERE </solution>.\nFor example: The answer to the question is <solution> 42 </solution>. \n\nYou have 1 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\nYou should take the last step to propose a solution.\n"}, "agent_action_count": {"propose_solution": 0, "use_tool": 1, "invalid_action": 4}, "token_counter": {"prompt_tokens": 7517, "total_tokens": 9629, "completion_tokens": 2112}, "terminate_reason": "max_steps", "error": null}, "task": {"task_name": "reasoning", "task_id": 27, "prompt": "Answer the following question with a number, a list of numbers or True or False.

The probability of an event is a number between 0 and 1, where, roughly speaking, 0 indicates impossibility of the event and 1 indicates certainty. The higher the probability of an event, the more likely it is that the event will occur. A simple example is the tossing of a fair (unbiased) coin. Since the coin is fair, the two outcomes (\"heads\" and \"tails\") are both equally probable; the probability of \"heads\" equals the probability of \"tails\"; and since no other outcomes are possible, the probability of either \"heads\" or \"tails\" is 1/2 (which could also be written as 0.5 or 50%).\nThese concepts have been given an axiomatic mathematical formalization in probability theory, which is used widely in areas of study such as statistics, mathematics, science, finance, gambling, artificial intelligence, machine\nYou have 4 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Assistant:\n\n<thought>\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Observation:\nI don't understand your input. \nIf you want to execute code, please use <execute> YOUR_CODE_HERE </execute>.\nIf you want to give me an answer, please use <solution> YOUR_SOLUTION_HERE </solution>.\nFor example: The answer to the question is <solution> 42 </solution>. \n\nYou have 3 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Assistant:\n\n<thought>\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Observation:\nI don't understand your input. \nIf you want to execute code, please use <execute> YOUR_CODE_HERE </execute>.\nIf you want to give me an answer, please use <solution> YOUR_SOLUTION_HERE </solution>.\nFor example: The answer to the question is <solution> 42 </solution>. \n\nYou have 2 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Assistant:\n\n<thought>\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Observation:\nI don't understand your input. \nIf you want to execute code, please use <execute> YOUR_CODE_HERE </execute>.\nIf you want to give me an answer, please use <solution> YOUR_SOLUTION_HERE </solution>.\nFor example: The answer to the question is <solution> 42 </solution>. \n\nYou have 1 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\nYou should take the last step to propose a solution.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Assistant:\n\n<thought>\n"}], "finished": true, "success": false, "latest_output": {"observation": "I don't understand your input. \nIf you want to execute code, please use <execute> YOUR_CODE_HERE </execute>.\nIf you want to give me an answer, please use <solution> YOUR_SOLUTION_HERE </solution>.\nFor example: The answer to the question is <solution> 42 </solution>. \n", "feedback": "", "feedback_type": "no_feedback", "success": false, "content": "Observation:\nI don't understand your input. \nIf you want to execute code, please use <execute> YOUR_CODE_HERE </execute>.\nIf you want to give me an answer, please use <solution> YOUR_SOLUTION_HERE </solution>.\nFor example: The answer to the question is <solution> 42 </solution>. \n\nYou have 1 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\nYou should take the last step to propose a solution.\n"}, "agent_action_count": {"propose_solution": 0, "use_tool": 1, "invalid_action": 4}, "token_counter": {"prompt_tokens": 7864, "total_tokens": 9974, "completion_tokens": 2110}, "terminate_reason": "max_steps", "error": null}, "task": {"task_name": "reasoning", "task_id": 40, "prompt": "Answer the following question with a number, a list of numbers or True or False.
