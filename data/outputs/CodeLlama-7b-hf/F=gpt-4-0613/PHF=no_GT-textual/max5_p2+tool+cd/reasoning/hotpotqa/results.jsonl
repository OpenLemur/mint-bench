In November 2010, the album was reissued as Bright Lights, spawning two singles: a cover of Elton John's \"Your Song\", which reached No.\u20092 on the UK Singles Chart; and \"Lights\", which peaked at No.\u20092 on the US Billboard Hot 100, becoming her highest-charting single to date. Goulding's second studio album, Halcyon, was released in 2012 and preceded by its lead single \"Anything Could Happen\".

Your thought process should be enclosed using \"<thought>\" tag, for example: <thought> I need to print \"Hello World!\" </thought>.\n\nAfter that, you have two options:\n\n1) Interact with a Python programming environment and receive the corresponding output.

You have successfully retrieved the birth year of Li Bai from the wiki search result. Next you should try to solve the calculus problem with the information you obtained.\n\nAssistant:\n<thought>\nFrom the wiki_search result, we can see that Li Bai was born in 701, thus M = 701.\nTo evaluate the double integral of $(x+y)^2$ over the region $C$, where $C$ is the circle defined by $x^2 + y^2 = 701$, we should use polar coordinates.\nIn polar coordinates, $x = r\\cos(\\theta)$ and $y = r\\sin(\\theta)$, and the differential area element $dx,dy$ becomes $r,dr,d\\theta$.\n$\\int\\int_C (x+y)^2 dx,dy = \\int_0^{2\\pi}\\int_0^{\\sqrt{701}} (r\\cos(\\theta) + r\\sin(\\theta))^2r,dr,d\\theta$\nLet's use the SymPy package to calculate this.\n</thought>\n<execute>\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate, cos, sin, pi\n\nr, theta = symbols('r theta')\n\n# the integrand\nintegrand = (r*cos(theta) + r*sin(theta))**2 * r\n\n# perform the double integration\ndouble_integral = integrate(integrate(integrand, (r, 0, 701 ** 0.5)), (theta, 0, 2*pi))\nprint(double_integral)\n</execute>\n\nObservation:\nOut[2]: 245700.5*pi\n\nExpert feedback:\nThis is GOOD.
