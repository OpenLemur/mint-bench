In conjunction with the neutron flux, it enables the calculation of the reaction rate, for example to derive the thermal power of a nuclear power plant. The standard unit for measuring the cross section is the barn, which is equal to 10\u221228 m2 or 10\u221224 cm2. The larger the neutron cross section, the more likely a neutron will react with the nucleus.\nAn isotope (or nuclide) can be classified according to its neutron cross section and how it reacts to an incident neutron.
