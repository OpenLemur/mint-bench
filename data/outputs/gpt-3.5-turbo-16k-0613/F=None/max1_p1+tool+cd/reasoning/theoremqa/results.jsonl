The volume of a cube is given by the formula V = s^3, where s is the length of the edge of the cube.\n\n2. We want to find a length s' such that (s')^3 = X * s^3.\n\n3. Taking the cube root of both sides, we get s' = X^(1/3) * s.\n\n4. We can construct a line segment of length X^(1/3) using the method of compass and straightedge construction.\n\n5. Therefore, we can construct the edge length of a cube such that the volume of the cube is equal to X times the volume of a given cube if and only if X^(1/3) is constructible.\n\nNow, let's determine if X^(1/3) is constructible for each value of X in the set {3, 17, 8, 27, 343, 1331}.\n\nTo do this, we need to check if X^(1/3) is a constructible number, which means it can be obtained using a finite number of operations of taking square roots and forming linear combinations of numbers.\n\nLet's analyze each value of X:\n\n1.

X = 1331: X^(1/3) = 1331^(1/3) = 11.
