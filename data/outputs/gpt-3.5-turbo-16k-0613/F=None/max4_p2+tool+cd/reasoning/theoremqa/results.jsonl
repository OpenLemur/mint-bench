However, the cube root of 3 is an irrational number, which cannot be constructed using compass and straightedge construction. Therefore, the answer for X = 3 is 0.\n\n2) X = 17:\nTo construct a cube with volume 17 times the volume of a given cube, we need to find the cube root of 17. Similarly, the cube root of 17 is an irrational number, so it cannot be constructed using compass and straightedge construction. Therefore, the answer for X = 17 is 0.\n\n3) X = 8:\nTo construct a cube with volume 8 times the volume of a given cube, we need to find the cube root of 8, which is 2. The edge length of the constructed cube would be 2 times the edge length of the given cube. Since we can construct a line segment with length 2 using compass and straightedge construction, we can construct the edge length of the cube. Therefore, the answer for X = 8 is 1.\n\n4) X = 27:\nTo construct a cube with volume 27 times the volume of a given cube, we need to find the cube root of 27, which is 3. The edge length of the constructed cube would be 3 times the edge length of the given cube. Since we can construct a line segment with length 3 using compass and straightedge construction, we can construct the edge length of the cube. Therefore, the answer for X = 27 is 1.\n\n5) X = 343:\nTo construct a cube with volume 343 times the volume of a given cube, we need to find the cube root of 343, which is 7. The edge length of the constructed cube would be 7 times the edge length of the given cube. Since we can construct a line segment with length 7 using compass and straightedge construction, we can construct the edge length of the cube. Therefore, the answer for X = 343 is 1.\n\n6) X = 1331:\nTo construct a cube with volume 1331 times the volume of a given cube, we need to find the cube root of 1331, which is 11. The edge length of the constructed cube would be 11 times the edge length of the given cube. Since we can construct a line segment with length 11 using compass and straightedge construction, we can construct the edge length of the cube.
