More simply, the speed of sound is how fast vibrations travel.\\nThe speed of sound in an ideal gas depends only on its temperature and composition.

To achieve this, you will be using an interactive coding environment equipped with a variety of tool functions to assist you throughout the process.\n\nAt each turn, you should first provide your step-by-step thinking for solving the task. Your thought process should be enclosed using \"<thought>\" tag, for example: <thought> I need to print \"Hello World!\" </thought>.\n\nAfter that, you have two options:\n\n1) Interact with a Python programming environment and receive the corresponding output. Your code should be enclosed using \"<execute>\" tag, for example: <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>.\n2) Directly provide a solution that adheres to the required format for the given task.
