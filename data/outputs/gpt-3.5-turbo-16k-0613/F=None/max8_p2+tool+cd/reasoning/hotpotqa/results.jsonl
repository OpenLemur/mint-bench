The set consists of three sonatas da chiesa in four movements and three partitas (or partias) in dance-form movements. The 2nd Partita is widely known for its Chaconne, considered one of the most masterly and expressive works ever written for solo violin.The set was completed by 1720 but was not published until 1802 by Nikolaus Simrock in Bonn.

A member of the Republican Party, Bush also served as the 43rd vice president from 1981 to 1989 under Ronald Reagan, in the U.S. House of Representatives, as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, and as Director of Central Intelligence.\nBush was born in Milton, Massachusetts, to Prescott Bush and Dorothy Walker Bush. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, Bush postponed his university studies, enlisted in the U.S. Navy on his 18th birthday, and became the youngest aviator in the U.S. Navy at the time. He served until September 1945, and then attended Yale University, graduating in 1948. He moved his family to West Texas where he entered the oil business and became a millionaire by the age of 40 in 1964. After founding his own oil company, Bush was defeated in his first run for the United States Senate in 1964, but won election to the House of Representatives from Texas's 7th congressional district in 1966. He was reelected in 1968 but was defeated for election to the Senate in 1970. In 1971, President Richard Nixon appointed Bush as Ambassador to the United Nations, and he served until becoming chairman of the Republican National Committee in 1973. The following year, President Gerald Ford appointed him Chief of the Liaison Office in China and later made him the director of Central Intelligence. Bush ran for president in 1980 but was defeated in the Republican primary by Ronald Reagan. Reagan chose Bush as his running mate, and Bush became vice president in 1981. As vice president, Bush generally took a low-profile role, but he was tasked with heading the task force on deregulation. In 1988, Bush won the Republican nomination for president and defeated Democratic opponent Michael Dukakis, becoming the first incumbent vice president to be elected president in 152 years. Foreign policy drove the Bush presidency; military operations were conducted in Panama and the Persian Gulf at a time of world change; the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 and the Soviet Union dissolved two years later. Domestically, Bush reneged on a 1988 campaign promise by signing a bill that increased taxes. He lost the 1992 presidential election to Democrat Bill Clinton following an economic recession and the decreased importance of foreign policy in a post\u2013Cold War political climate.\nYou have 6 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Observation:\nI don't understand your input. \nIf you want to execute code, please use <execute> YOUR_CODE_HERE </execute>.\nIf you want to give me an answer, please use <solution> YOUR_SOLUTION_HERE </solution>.\nFor example: The answer to the question is <solution> 42 </solution>. \n\nYou have 6 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Assistant:\n<thought> I apologize for the confusion.

Arizona and is aware that they have the right to remain silent, but does not explicitly invoke or waive the right.\nThe Court held that unless and until the suspect actually states that they are relying on their right(s), their subsequent voluntary statements may be used in court and police may continue to interact with (or question) them. The mere act of remaining silent is, on its own, insufficient to imply the suspect has invoked their rights. Furthermore, a voluntary reply even after lengthy silence can be construed as to implying a waiver.The Court was split, 5\u20134.
