The key parts of the task have been addressed: finding mugs, cooling them, and putting them away. My only suggestion would be to print out the mugs list after finding them, just so we can verify multiple mugs were identified if present. Otherwise, it seems you have understood how to systematically approach this type of task. Good work expanding and improving your solution based on feedback.\n"}, "agent_action_count": {"propose_solution": 0, "use_tool": 4, "invalid_action": 0}, "token_counter": {"prompt_tokens": 8289, "completion_tokens": 827, "total_tokens": 9116}, "terminate_reason": "error", "error": "InvalidRequestError\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/interact_eval/src/agents/openai_lm_agent.py\", line 41, in act\n    lm_output, token_usage = self.call_lm(messages)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/backoff/_sync.py\", line 105, in retry\n    ret = target(*args, **kwargs)\n  File \"/interact_eval/src/agents/openai_lm_agent.py\", line 29, in call_lm\n    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/openai/api_resources/chat_completion.py\", line 25, in create\n    return super().create(*args, **kwargs)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/openai/api_resources/abstract/engine_api_resource.py\", line 153, in create\n    response, _, api_key = requestor.request(\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/openai/api_requestor.py\", line 298, in request\n    resp, got_stream = self._interpret_response(result, stream)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/openai/api_requestor.py\", line 700, in _interpret_response\n    self._interpret_response_line(\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/openai/api_requestor.py\", line 763, in _interpret_response_line\n    raise self.handle_error_response(\nopenai.error.InvalidRequestError: This model's maximum context length is 4097 tokens.
