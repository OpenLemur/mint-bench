However, the cube root of 3 is an irrational number, which cannot be constructed using compass and straightedge construction. Therefore, the answer for X = 3 is 0.\n\n2) X = 17:\nSimilarly, the cube root of 17 is also an irrational number, so it cannot be constructed using compass and straightedge construction. The answer for X = 17 is 0.\n\n3) X = 8:\nThe cube root of 8 is 2, which is a rational number. We can construct a cube with edge length 2 times the edge length of a given cube using compass and straightedge construction. Therefore, the answer for X = 8 is 1.\n\n4) X = 27:\nThe cube root of 27 is 3, which is a rational number. We can construct a cube with edge length 3 times the edge length of a given cube using compass and straightedge construction. Therefore, the answer for X = 27 is 1.\n\n5) X = 343:\nThe cube root of 343 is 7, which is a rational number. We can construct a cube with edge length 7 times the edge length of a given cube using compass and straightedge construction. Therefore, the answer for X = 343 is 1.\n\n6) X = 1331:\nThe cube root of 1331 is 11, which is a rational number. We can construct a cube with edge length 11 times the edge length of a given cube using compass and straightedge construction.
