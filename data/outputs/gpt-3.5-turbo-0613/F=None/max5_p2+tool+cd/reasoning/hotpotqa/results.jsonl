There is disagreement whether the formal sciences are science disciplines, because they do not rely on empirical evidence.

A member of the Republican Party, Bush also served as the 43rd vice president from 1981 to 1989 under Ronald Reagan. He had previously served as the 11th director of Central Intelligence from 1976 to 1977 and as the 43rd vice president of the United States from 1981 to 1989 under Ronald Reagan. Bush is the longest-lived president in U.S. history and was the last president to have served in World War II. He was often referred to as George H. W. Bush, Bush Senior, or Bush 41, to distinguish him from his eldest son, George W. Bush, who served as the 43rd president from 2001 to 2009.\nBush was born in Milton, Massachusetts, to Prescott Bush and Dorothy Walker Bush. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, Bush postponed his university studies, enlisted in the U.S. Navy on his 18th birthday, and became the youngest aviator in the U.S. Navy at the time. He served until September 1945 and then attended Yale University, graduating in 1948. He moved his family to West Texas where he entered the oil business and became a millionaire by the age of 40 in 1964. After founding his own oil company, Bush was defeated in his first run for the United States Senate in 1964, but won election to the House of Representatives from Texas's 7th congressional district in 1966. He was reelected in 1968 but was defeated for election to the Senate in 1970. In 1971, President Richard Nixon appointed Bush as Ambassador to the United Nations, and he served until becoming chairman of the Republican National Committee in 1973. The following year, President Gerald Ford appointed him Chief of the Liaison Office in China and later made him the director of Central Intelligence. Bush ran for president in 1980 but was defeated in the Republican primary by Ronald Reagan.

To achieve this, you will be using an interactive coding environment equipped with a variety of tool functions to assist you throughout the process.\n\nAt each turn, you should first provide your step-by-step thinking for solving the task. Your thought process should be enclosed using \"<thought>\" tag, for example: <thought> I need to print \"Hello World!\" </thought>.\n\nAfter that, you have two options:\n\n1) Interact with a Python programming environment and receive the corresponding output. Your code should be enclosed using \"<execute>\" tag, for example: <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>.\n2) Directly provide a solution that adheres to the required format for the given task. Your solution should be enclosed using \"<solution>\" tag, for example: The answer is <solution> A </solution>.\n\nYou have 5 chances to interact with the environment or propose a solution.
