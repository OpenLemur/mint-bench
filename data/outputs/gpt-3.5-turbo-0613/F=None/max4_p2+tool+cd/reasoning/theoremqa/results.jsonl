However, the cube root of 3 is an irrational number, which cannot be constructed using compass and straightedge construction. Therefore, the answer for X = 3 is 0.\n\n2) X = 17:\nTo construct a cube with volume 17 times the volume of a given cube, we need to find the cube root of 17. Similar to X = 3, the cube root of 17 is an irrational number and cannot be constructed using compass and straightedge construction. Therefore, the answer for X = 17 is 0.\n\n3) X = 8:\nTo construct a cube with volume 8 times the volume of a given cube, we need to find the cube root of 8, which is 2. We can construct a cube with edge length 2 times the edge length of the given cube using compass and straightedge construction. Therefore, the answer for X = 8 is 1.\n\n4) X = 27:\nTo construct a cube with volume 27 times the volume of a given cube, we need to find the cube root of 27, which is 3. We can construct a cube with edge length 3 times the edge length of the given cube using compass and straightedge construction. Therefore, the answer for X = 27 is 1.\n\n5) X = 343:\nTo construct a cube with volume 343 times the volume of a given cube, we need to find the cube root of 343, which is 7. We can construct a cube with edge length 7 times the edge length of the given cube using compass and straightedge construction. Therefore, the answer for X = 343 is 1.\n\n6) X = 1331:\nTo construct a cube with volume 1331 times the volume of a given cube, we need to find the cube root of 1331, which is 11. We can construct a cube with edge length 11 times the edge length of the given cube using compass and straightedge construction.
