Gollum was a Stoor Hobbit of the River-folk who lived near the Gladden Fields. In The Lord of the Rings it is stated that he was originally known as Sm\u00e9agol, corrupted by the One Ring, and later named Gollum after his habit of making \"a horrible swallowing noise in his throat\".Sm\u00e9agol obtained the Ring by murdering his relative D\u00e9agol, who found it in the River Anduin. Gollum referred to the Ring as \"my precious\" or \"precious\", and it extended his life far beyond natural limits. Centuries of the Ring's influence twisted Gollum's body and mind, and, by the time of the novels, he \"loved and hated [the Ring], as he loved and hated himself.\" Throughout the story, Gollum was torn between his lust for the Ring and his desire to be free of it.

You have successfully retrieved the birth year of Li Bai from the wiki search result. Next you should try to solve the calculus problem with the information you obtained.\n\nAssistant:\n<thought>\nFrom the wiki_search result, we can see that Li Bai was born in 701, thus M = 701.\nTo evaluate the double integral of $(x+y)^2$ over the region $C$, where $C$ is the circle defined by $x^2 + y^2 = 701$, we should use polar coordinates.\nIn polar coordinates, $x = r\\cos(\\theta)$ and $y = r\\sin(\\theta)$, and the differential area element $dx,dy$ becomes $r,dr,d\\theta$.\n$\\int\\int_C (x+y)^2 dx,dy = \\int_0^{2\\pi}\\int_0^{\\sqrt{701}} (r\\cos(\\theta) + r\\sin(\\theta))^2r,dr,d\\theta$\nLet's use the SymPy package to calculate this.\n</thought>\n<execute>\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate, cos, sin, pi\n\nr, theta = symbols('r theta')\n\n# the integrand\nintegrand = (r*cos(theta) + r*sin(theta))**2 * r\n\n# perform the double integration\ndouble_integral = integrate(integrate(integrand, (r, 0, 701 ** 0.5)), (theta, 0, 2*pi))\nprint(double_integral)\n</execute>\n\nObservation:\nOut[2]: 245700.5*pi\n\nExpert feedback:\nThis is GOOD. You successfully converted the double integral into a form that can be calculated. Now you can convert the answer to meet the output format requirement.\n\nAssistant:\n<thought> Let's round this result to three decimal places using half up rounding rule. </thought>\n<execute>\nimport math\nprint(round(245700.5*math.pi, 3))\n</execute>\n\nObservation:\n771890.886\n\nExpert feedback:\nThis is GOOD.

Arizona and is aware that they have the right to remain silent, but does not explicitly invoke or waive the right.\nThe Court held that unless and until the suspect actually states that they are relying on their right(s), their subsequent voluntary statements may be used in court and police may continue to interact with (or question) them. The mere act of remaining silent is, on its own, insufficient to imply the suspect has invoked their rights. Furthermore, a voluntary reply even after lengthy silence can be construed as to implying a waiver.The Court was split, 5\u20134.
