The show's first season was derived from the novel Darkly Dreaming Dexter (2004), the first in a series of novels by Jeff Lindsay. It was adapted for television by James Manos Jr., who wrote the first episode. Subsequent seasons evolved independently of Lindsay's works.\nIn February 2008, reruns (edited down to a TV-14 rating) began to air on CBS in the wake of the shortage of original programming ensuing from the 2007\u201308 Writers Guild of America strike, thus the reruns\nYou have 4 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\n\nExpert feedback:\nThis is GOOD.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Assistant:\n<thought> From the Wikipedia search result, we can see that Michael C.

In the spring of 1837, the violence was brought under control after the government deployed troops to arrest the Shiners.

Sonata is a vague term, with varying meanings depending on the context and time period. By the early 19th century, it came to represent a principle of composing large-scale works. It was applied to most instrumental genres and regarded\u2014alongside the fugue\u2014as one of two fundamental methods of organizing, interpreting and analyzing concert music.

As with their previous two albums From Under the Cork Tree (2005) and Infinity on High (2007), its music was composed by lead vocalist and guitarist Patrick Stump, with lyrics penned by bassist Pete Wentz. Regarding the writing process, the band considered Folie \u00e0 Deux to be their most collaborative record.\nUnlike their earlier releases, the album was recorded in relative secrecy with producer Neal Avron from July to September 2008. The recording sessions inspired lyricism relating to decaying relationships, moral dilemmas, and societal shortcomings, many with a political edge.
