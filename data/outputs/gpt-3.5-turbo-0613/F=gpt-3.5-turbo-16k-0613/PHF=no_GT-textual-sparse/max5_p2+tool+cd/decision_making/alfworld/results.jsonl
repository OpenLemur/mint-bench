You systematically checked different locations to find the bowl and the desklamp, which is a good strategy.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where you can improve:\n\n1. Efficiency: Instead of checking each shelf, desk, and drawer one by one, you can prioritize the locations that are more likely to have the objects you need. For example, you can start by checking the shelves first, as bowls are more likely to be found there. This way, you can potentially find the bowl faster and have more time to find the desklamp.\n\n2. Receptacle status: Before opening a receptacle, it's important to check if it's already open or closed. This will save you time and unnecessary actions. For example, if a shelf is already open, you don't need to open it again.\n\n3. Clarity of thought process: While your thoughts were generally clear, it would be helpful to explicitly state your plan before executing it. This will make it easier for others to follow your reasoning and understand your actions.\n\nKeep up the good work and continue to refine your problem-solving skills!\n"}, "agent_action_count": {"propose_solution": 1, "use_tool": 4, "invalid_action": 0}, "token_counter": {"prompt_tokens": 10263, "completion_tokens": 890, "total_tokens": 11153, "feedback_prompt_tokens": 2156, "feedback_completion_tokens": 249, "feedback_total_tokens": 2405}, "terminate_reason": "max_steps", "error": null}, "task": {"task_name": "alfworld/examine", "task_id": "look_at_obj_in_light-Bowl-None-DeskLamp-308/trial_T20190907_133953_562557", "prompt": "Interact with a household to solve a task. \nYou are in the middle of a room.
