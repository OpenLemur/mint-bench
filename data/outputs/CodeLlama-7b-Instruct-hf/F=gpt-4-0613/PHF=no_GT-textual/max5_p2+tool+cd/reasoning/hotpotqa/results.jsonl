In the 1960s and 1970s, he moved towards sexploitation and pornographic films such as  The Sinister Urge (1960), Orgy of the Dead (1965) and Necromania (1971), and wrote over 80 lurid pulp crime and sex novels.\nNotable for their campy aesthetics, technical errors, unsophisticated special effects, use of poorly-matched stock footage, eccentric casts, idiosyncratic stories and non sequitur dialogue, Wood's films remained largely obscure until he was posthumously awarded a Golden Turkey Award for Worst Director of All Time in 1980, renewing public interest in his life and work.Following the p\nYou have 3 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\n\nExpert feedback:\nThis is GOOD.

He was appointed as the maestro di cappella at the Cappella Musicale del Duomo in Naples at the age of 15, and later became the maestro di cappella at the Cappella Musicale del Duomo in Rome.\nScarlatti's music is characterized by its technical skill and emotional depth. He was known for his ability to create complex and intricate melodies, and his use of harmony and counterpoint. He was also known for his use of the \"stile galante\" style, which was characterized by a light and playful tone.\nScarlatti's most famous work is the Concerto Grosso in D major, which is considered one of the greatest works of the Baroque period. He also composed many other works, including sonatas, concertos, and operas.\nScarlatti was a highly influential composer, and his music had a significant impact on the development of classical music.
