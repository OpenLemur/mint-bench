One way to do this is to use the `itemgetter` function from the `operator` module. The `itemgetter` function takes a list of indices and returns a function that takes an element `x` from the list `l` and returns the value at the corresponding indices.\n\nHere's an example of how to use `itemgetter` to modify the key function:\n```\nfrom operator import itemgetter\n\ndef sort_even(l: list):\n    return sorted(l, key=itemgetter(::2))\n```\nThis code defines a new function `sort_even` that takes a list `l` and returns a sorted list of the even elements of `l`. The key function is defined using `itemgetter(::2)`, which returns the value at the even indices of the list `x`.\n\nI hope this\n"}], "finished": true, "success": false, "latest_output": {"observation": "---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[2], line 4\n      1 def sort_even(l: list):\n      2     return sorted(l, key=lambda x: x[::2])\n----> 4 assert sort_even([1, 2, 3]) == [1, 2, 3]\n      5 assert sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4]) == [3, 6, 5, 4]\n\nCell In[2], line 2, in sort_even(l)\n      1 def sort_even(l: list):\n----> 2     return sorted(l, key=lambda x: x[::2])\n\nCell In[2], line 2, in sort_even.<locals>.<lambda>(x)\n      1 def sort_even(l: list):\n----> 2     return sorted(l, key=lambda x: x[::2])\n\nTypeError: 'int' object is not subscriptable", "feedback": "", "feedback_type": "no_feedback", "success": false, "content": "Observation:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[2], line 4\n      1 def sort_even(l: list):\n      2     return sorted(l, key=lambda x: x[::2])\n----> 4 assert sort_even([1, 2, 3]) == [1, 2, 3]\n      5 assert sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4]) == [3, 6, 5, 4]\n\nCell In[2], line 2, in sort_even(l)\n      1 def sort_even(l: list):\n----> 2     return sorted(l, key=lambda x: x[::2])\n\nCell In[2], line 2, in sort_even.<locals>.<lambda>(x)\n      1 def sort_even(l: list):\n----> 2     return sorted(l, key=lambda x: x[::2])\n\nTypeError: 'int' object is not subscriptable\nYou have 1 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\nYou should take the last step to propose a solution.\n"}, "agent_action_count": {"propose_solution": 0, "use_tool": 3, "invalid_action": 0}, "token_counter": {"prompt_tokens": 4909, "total_tokens": 6075, "completion_tokens": 1166}, "terminate_reason": "max_steps", "error": null}, "task": {"task_name": "humaneval", "task_id": 10, "prompt": "Complete the following code:\n\ndef sort_even(l: list):\n    \"\"\"This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that\n    l' is identical to l in the odd indicies, while its values at the even indicies are equal\n    to the values of the even indicies of l, but sorted.\n    >>> sort_even([1, 2, 3])\n    [1, 2, 3]\n    >>> sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4])\n    [3, 6, 5, 4]\n    \"\"\"", "reference": "\n\n\nMETADATA = {}\n\n\ndef check(candidate):\n    assert tuple(candidate([1, 2, 3])) == tuple([1, 2, 3])\n    assert tuple(candidate([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])) == tuple([-10, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 5, 0, 9, 1, 123])\n    assert tuple(candidate([5, 8, -12, 4, 23, 2, 3, 11, 12, -10])) == tuple([-12, 8, 3, 4, 5, 2, 12, 11, 23, -10])\n\n\ncheck(sort_even)", "metadata": {}}, "final_length_exceeds_4096": false}
