Let f be a real function on [0,1]. If the bounded variation of f on [0,1] equals f(1)-f(0), then: Options: a ) f is increasing on [0,1] , b ) f is decreasing on [0,1] , c ) None of the above. Which one is correct?\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Assistant:\n The correct answer is (a) f is increasing on [0,1].\n\nTo see why, let's first recall the definition of bounded variation. A function f on an interval [a,b] is said to have bounded variation if there exists a partition P of [a,b] such that the total variation of f over P is bounded by a constant M. In other words, there exists a partition P such that the sum of the absolute values of the differences between consecutive points in f is less than or equal to M.\n\nNow, let's consider the given condition that the bounded variation of f on [0,1] equals f(1)-f(0). This means that there exists a partition P of [0,1] such that the total variation of f over P is equal to f(1)-f(0).\n\nSince f is a real function on [0,1], it is continuous on [0,1]. Therefore, it is also uniformly continuous on [0,1]. This means that for any \u03b5 > 0, there exists a \u03b4 > 0 such that for any x,y in [0,1] with |x-y| < \u03b4, we have |f(x) - f(y)| < \u03b5.\n\nNow, let's consider the partition P of [0,1] such that the total variation of f over P is equal to f(1)-f(0).
