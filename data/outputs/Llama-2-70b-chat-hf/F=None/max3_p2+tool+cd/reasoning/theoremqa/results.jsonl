Since neutrons have no electric charge, they can enter a nucleus more easily than positively charged protons, which are repelled electrostatically.Neutron capture plays a significant role in the cosmic nucleosynthesis of heavy elements. In stars it can proceed in two ways: as a rapid process (r-process) or a slow process (s-process). Nuclei of masses greater than 56 cannot be formed by thermonuclear reactions (i.e., by nuclear fusion) but can be formed by neutron capture.\nNeutron capture on protons yields a line at 2.223 MeV predicted and commonly observed in solar flares.\n\nPage: Neutron capture nucleosynthesis\nSummary: Neutron capture nucleosynthesis describes two nucleosynthesis pathways: the r-process and the s-process, for rapid and slow neutron captures, respectively.

More simply, the speed of sound is how fast vibrations travel.\nThe speed of sound in an ideal gas depends only on its temperature and composition. The speed has a weak dependence on frequency and pressure in ordinary air, deviating slightly from ideal behavior.\nIn colloquial speech, speed of sound refers to the speed of sound waves in air.

If the time is 7:00 now, then 8 hours later it will be 3:00. Simple addition would result in 7 + 8 = 15, but clocks \"wrap around\" every 12 hours. Because the hour number starts over at zero when it reaches 12, this is arithmetic modulo 12.

Dry friction is subdivided into static friction (\"stiction\") between non-moving surfaces, and kinetic friction between moving surfaces. With the exception of atomic or molecular friction, dry friction generally arises from the interaction of surface features, known as asperities (see Figure 1).\nFluid friction describes the friction between layers of a viscous fluid that are moving relative to each other.Lubricated friction is a case of fluid friction where a lubricant fluid separates two solid surfaces.Skin friction is a component of drag, the force resisting the motion of a fluid across the surface of a body.\nInternal friction is the force resisting motion between the elements making up a solid\nYou have 2 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " Assistant:\n<thought> We can use the formula for the minimum coefficient of static friction to solve this problem.
