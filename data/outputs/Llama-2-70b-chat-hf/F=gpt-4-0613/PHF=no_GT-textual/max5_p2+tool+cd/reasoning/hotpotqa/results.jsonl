It was released as the lead single from Delirium on 17 September 2015 by Polydor Records. Written by Goulding, Max Martin, Savan Kotecha and Ilya Salmanzadeh, \"On My Mind\" is an electropop and R&B song whose instrumentation consists of scratchy guitars, trap drums, slapped beats and sharp, syncopated electronica. Lyrically, \"On My Mind\" talks about a one-night stand with someone the protagonist should not be with, prompting a dichotomy between heart and head. Though firmly denied by Goulding, many critics considered it an answer song to Ed Sheeran's \"Don't\".\n\"On My Mind\" received mostly positive reviews from music critics, who praised it for being a radio-friendly song, as well as Goulding's vocals.
