It is defined as the negative of the second derivative of the log-likelihood function with respect to $\\theta$.\n\nFor the Gaussian distribution, the log-likelihood function is given by:\n\n$$\\ell(\\theta) = -\\frac{n}{2}\\log(2\\pi\\theta) - \\frac{1}{2\\theta}\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\\mu)^2$$\n\nwhere $n$ is the sample size, $\\mu$ is the mean of the distribution, and $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n$ are the observations.\n\nTaking the second derivative of $\\ell(\\theta)$ with respect to $\\theta$, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2\\ell}{\\partial\\theta^2} = -\\frac{n}{2\\theta^2} - \\frac{1}{\\theta^2}\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\\mu)^2$$\n\nSetting this expression to zero and solving for $\\theta$, we get:\n\n$$\\theta = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\\mu)^2$$\n\nThis expression is the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of $\\theta$.\n\nThe Fisher information is defined as the negative of the second derivative of the log-likelihood function with respect to $\\theta$.
