For a continuous function of several variables, the meaning of the definition is the same, except for the fact that the continuous path to be considered cannot be the whole graph of the given function (which is a hypersurface in this case), but can be every intersection of the graph itself with a hyperplane (in the case of functions of two variables, a plane) parallel to a fixed x-axis and to the y-axis.\nFunctions of bounded variation are precisely those with respect to which o\nYou have 4 steps left and 2 chances to propose solution left.\n\nExpert feedback:\nThis is GOOD.

You have successfully retrieved the birth year of Li Bai from the wiki search result. Next you should try to solve the calculus problem with the information you obtained.\n\nAssistant:\n<thought>\nFrom the wiki_search result, we can see that Li Bai was born in 701, thus M = 701.\nTo evaluate the double integral of $(x+y)^2$ over the region $C$, where $C$ is the circle defined by $x^2 + y^2 = 701$, we should use polar coordinates.\nIn polar coordinates, $x = r\\cos(\\theta)$ and $y = r\\sin(\\theta)$, and the differential area element $dx,dy$ becomes $r,dr,d\\theta$.\n$\\int\\int_C (x+y)^2 dx,dy = \\int_0^{2\\pi}\\int_0^{\\sqrt{701}} (r\\cos(\\theta) + r\\sin(\\theta))^2r,dr,d\\theta$\nLet's use the SymPy package to calculate this.\n</thought>\n<execute>\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate, cos, sin, pi\n\nr, theta = symbols('r theta')\n\n# the integrand\nintegrand = (r*cos(theta) + r*sin(theta))**2 * r\n\n# perform the double integration\ndouble_integral = integrate(integrate(integrand, (r, 0, 701 ** 0.5)), (theta, 0, 2*pi))\nprint(double_integral)\n</execute>\n\nObservation:\nOut[2]: 245700.5*pi\n\nExpert feedback:\nThis is GOOD. You successfully converted the double integral into a form that can be calculated. Now you can convert the answer to meet the output format requirement.\n\nAssistant:\n<thought> Let's round this result to three decimal places using half up rounding rule. </thought>\n<execute>\nimport math\nprint(round(245700.5*math.pi, 3))\n</execute>\n\nObservation:\n771890.886\n\nExpert feedback:\nThis is GOOD.
