Your code should be enclosed using \"<execute>\" tag, for example: <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>.\n2) Directly provide a solution that adheres to the required format for the given task. Your solution should be enclosed using \"<solution>\" tag, for example: The answer is <solution> A </solution>.\n\nYou have 6 chances to interact with the environment or propose a solution. You can only propose a solution 2 times.\n\nTool function available (already imported in <execute> environment):\n[1] put(object: str, receptacle: str) -> str\nPut an object in/on a receptacle.\nFor example: put(\"mug 1\", \"desk 2\")\n\n[2] goto(receptacle: str) -> str\nGo to a location of the receptacle.\nFor example: goto(\"drawer 1\")\n\n[3] take_from(object: str, receptacle: str) -> str\nTake an object from a receptacle.\nFor example: take_from(\"mug 1\", \"shelf 2\")\n\n[4] open_receptacle(receptacle: str) -> str\nOpen a receptacle.\nFor example: open_receptacle(\"fridge 1\")\n\n[5] toggle(object_or_receptacle: str) -> str\nToggle an object or receptacle.\nFor example: toggle(\"light 2\")\n\n[6] close_receptacle(receptacle: str) -> str\nClose a receptacle.\nFor example: close_receptacle(\"microwave 1\")\n\n[7] clean(object: str, receptacle: str) -> str\nClean an object with a receptacle.\nFor example: clean(\"cloth 1\", \"sinkbasin 1\")\n\n[8] heat(object: str, receptacle: str) -> str\nHeat an object with a receptacle.\nFor example: heat(\"egg 1\", \"microwave 1\")\n\n[9] cool(object: str, receptacle: str) -> str\nCool an object with a receptacle.\nFor example: cool(\"bottle 1\", \"fridge 1\")\n\n[10] use(receptacle: str) -> str\nUse a receptacle.\nFor example: use(\"lamp 1\")\n\n[11] look() -> str\nLook around. It will return what you see in the room.\nFor example: look()\n\n\n\n---\n\nTask:\nYou are in the middle of a room.
